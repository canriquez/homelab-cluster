--- # We string toghetter this two yaml files because they are

# This is a ConfigMap that contains the config.yaml file for cloudflared.
# The config.yaml file is used by cloudflared to configure the tunnel.
# The config.yaml file is mounted as a volume in the cloudflared deployment.
# The config.yaml file is used to configure the tunnel and the ingress rules.
# The ingress rules are used to route traffic from the tunnel to the linkding service.

# This ConfigMap is just a way to define the cloudflared config.yaml file in k8s.
# It's useful to define it in k8s, rather than as a stand-alone .yaml file, because
# this lets you use various k8s templating solutions (e.g. Helm charts) to
# parameterize your config, instead of just using string literals.
